          Like a spotlight the water hits me
          <br><br>Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
          <br><br>Though I know that no one's listening
          <br><br>I nervously rehearse for when you're around
          <br><br>And I keep waiting like
          <br><br>you might change my mind
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Who wrote the book on goodbye
          <br><br>There's never been a way to make this easy
          <br><br>When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
          <br><br>Either your head or your heart
          <br><br>you set the other on fire
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
          <br><br>Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
          <br><br>Though I know that our time is ending
          <br><br>I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
          <br><br>And I keep waiting like
          <br><br>you might change my mind
          <br><br>Give me one more night
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Who wrote the book on goodbye
          <br><br>There's never been a way to make this easy
          <br><br>When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
          <br><br>Either your head or your heart
          <br><br>you set the other on fire
          <br><br>
          <br><br>No one knows knows
          <br><br>No one knows knows
          <br><br>
          <br><br>We fell from the peak
          <br><br>And the stars they broke their code
          <br><br>I'm trying to forget
          <br><br>How I landed on this road
          <br><br>I'm caught in between
          <br><br>What I wish and what I know
          <br><br>When they say that you just know
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Who wrote the book on goodbye
          <br><br>There's never been a way to make this easy
          <br><br>When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
          <br><br>Either your head or your heart
          <br><br>you set the other on fire
          <br><br>
          <br><br>No one knows knows
          <br><br>No one knows knows
          <br><br>No one knows knows
          <br><br>
          <br><br>You set the other on fire
          <br><br>You set the other on fire
          <br><br>You set the other on fire
          <br><br>you set the other on fire
