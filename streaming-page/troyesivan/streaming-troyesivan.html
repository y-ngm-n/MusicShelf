          The sun sets longer
          <br><br>Where I am from
          <br><br>Where dreams go to die
          <br><br>While having fun
          <br><br>The boys fix their cars and
          <br><br>Girls heat it up
          <br><br>Loving's so good when
          <br><br>Love is young
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Yeah there's so much history in these streets
          <br><br>And mama's good eats
          <br><br>Oh Wonder on repeat
          <br><br>There's so much history in my head

          <br><br>The ones that I've kept
          <br><br>Have you heard me on the radio?
          <br><br>Did you turn it up?
          <br><br>On your blown-out stereo
          <br><br>In suburbia
          <br><br>Could be playing hide and seek from home
          <br><br>Can't replace my blood
          <br><br>Yeah it seems I'm never letting go
          <br><br>Of suburbia
          <br><br>
          <br><br>Swallow nostalgia,
          <br><br>Chase it with lime
          <br><br>Better than dwelling
          <br><br>And chasing time
          <br><br>Missing occasions
          <br><br>I can't rewind
          <br><br>Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine
          <br><br>
